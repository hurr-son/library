# library

Finished another fun project from The Odin Project's Javascript section.
This project tested my knowledge related to javascript's object constructors, the objects they make, and arrays. 
I was most hungup on finding a solution for a delete button on each entry.
I didn't know about a certain method, which I can imagine is so common, given the depth of javascript. 

Here is the first [version](https://hurr-son.github.io/library/).

I plan on returning to the project once the backend section is covered so I can add some data storage.
